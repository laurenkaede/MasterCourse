<h6>About Me</h6>

        <p>Hello, my name’s Lauren and I’m a tech enthusiast from Manchester. Everything changed when I became really interested in online business, and how technology impacts the lives of others. Technological innovation is something I’m really passionate about, and in today’s digital world a lot of businesses are finding success online. This of course creates a lot of opportunities, and I’ve spent hours researching how to start my own online business, particularly in e-commerce and digital products.</p>

        <p>During this process I watched a lot of tutorials, read lots of books, and took a few online courses in subjects including digital marketing and JavaScript. This led me to build my own Shopify store and my own website in wordpress. But ultimately I realised that I didn’t want to be using someone else's software to create something that everyone else was creating… I wanted to create something that was my own work, that I could build from scratch.</p>

        <p>And that’s what led me to taking a coding course here at Codenation. On day 3 of the course we were set a challenge to build an ATM using Python. And after completing the challenge and making my tweaks, I sat back and ran the code. And that moment when you see that it works is just an incredible feeling. A huge smile broke out on my face and I was so excited. It was at that moment that it all just clicked for me and I realised that I’d finally found what I was supposed to be doing.</p>

        <p>Software development allows me to be creative and to use my brain to solve problems. But most importantly I will get to help people which is so rewarding and something I’m really passionate about. My goal is to build an exciting and rewarding career as a software developer, and I look forward to the challenges and growth of the future.</p>
