    <h2>1.1 - Describing the Purpose of IT in Modern Business </h2>

    <p>The key to success in modern business is the ability to be innovative, and information technology is what drives innovation. IT isn’t just comprised of computers and the internet, it also includes telecommunications, printers and radio equipment.</p>

    <p>Business in the 20th century could be successful without innovation as efficiency wasn’t necessary, but that all changed when Tim Berners-Lee created the internet. In the 21st century modern business has come to thrive online through the use of IT, with innovation at the core of accelerated business growth. For example, it is much more efficient to buy products online than to go shopping at physical stores, and the e-commerce opportunities are huge for online business owners. IT has allowed new businesses the opportunity to start with very little funds, have minimal overhead costs; and digital marketing is much more cost effective and scalable with the use of social media, than traditional marketing methods. </p>

    <p>Modern businesses now have the opportunity to scale globally rather than being restricted to their local area through the implementation of IT. Efficient communication and the ability to build relationships and provide with customers is also a fundamental difference that IT brings to modern business. Innovation through the use of IT has given modern businesses the tools to be more efficient, solve complex problems, undertake market research on a global scale, market products digitally and improved resource management. <a href="references.html" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="references.html" target="_blank">[2]</a> <a href="references.html" target="_blank">[3]</a> <a href="references.html" target="_blank">[4]</a> </p>
