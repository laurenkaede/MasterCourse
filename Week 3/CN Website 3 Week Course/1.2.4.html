        <h2>2.4 - Describe Further Improvements You Can Make to Your Project </h2>


        <p>Given more time, I would have liked to have added more images pertaining to the subject content such as software development and digital projects. I would have also liked to have included some extra features to increase accessibility such as alt tags. Alt tags would allow users to access a description of my images in the event that they had difficulty viewing images properly. I would also have liked to have organised my navigation bar code so that it allowed more flexibility with further coding. I wasnâ€™t quite happy with the appearance of my text, or the font that I used. This is something that I would improve if I was to make another website. Text placement is another thing that I could have made further improvements on, especially in conjunction with image placement. Background images could also have been improved by ensuring that they were all consistent with a particular theme.</p>
        <p>The planning stages of my project could also have been improved by utilising draw.io in conjunction with Trello. This would have enabled me to be more efficient and increased productivity. I would also have used Github from the start for the version control element as this would have allowed me to have stayed more organised.</p>
