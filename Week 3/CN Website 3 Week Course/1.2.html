    <h2>1.2 - Describing Methods, Skills and Resources Needed to Complete Digital Projects Successfully </h2>

        <p>A digital project comprises the processes used to create an electronic publication such as a website, digital image or ebook. These processes include the planning, preparation and production of a product which is developed and delivered digitally. In order to complete a digital project successfully, it is important to implement efficient methods, skills and resources. </p>
        
        <h4>Methods</h4>     

            <p>When creating a digital project, there are five stages that most electronic publications go through. The first stage is called <b>scoping</b>, and is where the initial brainstorming and ideation takes place. This stage also includes evaluating the potential challenges and risks, creating a timeline and estimating how much the project will cost to produce. The second stage is the <b>planning</b> phase. This is where a detailed plan is created for the product design specifications, its requirements, functionality and strategy. The third stage is <b>development</b>. This is where the development team can start implementing the design specifications. The process begins with back-end and finishes with front-end development, with alpha and beta versions created on the back-end. The fourth stage is the <b>testing and deployment</b> of the digital product. This is where the digital product is tested to ensure it works and functions properly. Once testing is complete, a quality assessment is undertaken before deployment of the product to the public begins and the project can go live. The last phase is <b>maintenance</b> of the digital project. This includes bug fixes, updates to the product, ensuring the product remains stable, improving functionality, consumer support, and any further developments to the product. <a href="references.html" target="_blank">[5]</a> <a href="references.html" target="_blank">[6]</a> </p>
          
        <h4>Skills</h4>

            <p>There are many skills required to create a digital project. To create a digital project you will need to have organisational, research, motivational, planning and creative skills to organise your time efficiently, perform product research, motivate yourself to work on the project, plan the project in detail and create the product idea and generate design specifications. Another important skill when creating a digital project is the ability to implement its development by understanding and using HTML and CSS code. During the development you will also need problem solving skills when facing problems and bug fixes, and know how to be resourceful so that you know where to go if you need help or support during your project.</p>

            <p>For example, if you are going to create an ebook digital project, you will first need to generate and plan the idea for your book, write the content, create the code to create your ebook, solve any problems and fix any bugs, and then know how to research and find (or create) a platform in which to publish your digital product. Once the product is created, it’s then important to implement digital marketing skills to generate consumers.</p>

        <h4>Resources</h4>

            <p>When creating a digital project, there are many tools and resources that can be used. <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> and <a href="https://www.forecast.app/" target="_blank">Forecast</a> are similar tools that can be used throughout the project, but will especially be useful with the planning stages of the product. Trello is a great resource as it allows you to create a board to plan out your projects by breaking down tasks. You can also set time deadlines, and it is extremely user friendly. Slack is a great communication tool to use if you are creating a digital project with a team of people as it enables you to share files and code. Visual Studio Code is a code editor that allows the user to create code for a digital project. It has some useful features such as debugging and task running. Wordpress is a management system which includes the tools needed to create your own website or blog. It has many themes and plugins that the user can implement, and is highly integratable. Draw.io is a useful resource to create flowcharts. It gives the user the tools to create a plan for the product design specifications. It’s a great tool to visualise how your product will look and function. <a href="references.html" target="_blank">[7]</a> <a href="references.html" target="_blank">[8]</a> <a href="references.html" target="_blank">[9]</a> <a href="references.html" target="_blank">[10]</a> <a href="references.html" target="_blank">[11]</a> <a href="references.html" target="_blank">[12]</a> </p>
