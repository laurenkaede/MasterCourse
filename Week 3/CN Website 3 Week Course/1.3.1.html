        <h2>3.1 - Review the Beneﬁts and Drawbacks of IT Tools and Systems Used in Terms of Productivity and Efficiency </h2>
  
        <p>Overall I am happy with the IT tools and systems that I used to create my digital project. Trello was extremely useful in helping me to be productive and efficient. The Kanban method is an especially useful tool that Trello provides and easily allows me to stay organised in an efficient way, whilst improving productivity. One of the drawbacks of Trello is that the labelling system wasn’t particularly useful as it didn’t really provide much of a benefit for my particular project. This could be down to how I utilised the labels, and perhaps I didn’t use them to their full potential.</p>

        <p>Visual Studio Code was fundamental in the creation of my code. One of the main ways in which it benefitted me was by using one main file for my CSS code. This feature allowed me to save a lot of time, was highly efficient, improved productivity and made it easier to organise my CSS code. One of the drawbacks was having so many HTML files for my digital project. There didn’t appear to be an easy way to organise the files, which made it difficult to navigate around my HTML code. It was inefficient and decreased productivity as it took more time to implement HTML on so many different files.</p>
