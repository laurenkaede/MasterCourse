        <h2>3.2 - Describe Ways to Improve Productivity and Efficiency </h2>

        <p>Productively and efficiency could have been improved by utilising Trello to its full potential, such as using labels to maximise their use. It may have been helpful to have more lists on Trello and to have tasks grouped to the phase in which they pertained. It would have been more efficient to have used Visual Studio Code on a bigger monitor. This would have enabled me to view my HTML files in a more efficient way. Perhaps having each section of my website in a separate folder would have also helped with my productivity and efficiency as this would have potentially saved me time. If I had to do this project again, I would have worked in three clear stages. Produce written content first, implement HTML code second, and style my website with CSS code last. Unfortunately, I found myself moving between the different stages and I think this was inefficient and slowed down productivity.</p>
