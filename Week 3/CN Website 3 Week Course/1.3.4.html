        <h2>3.4 - Describe How You Would Go About Testing Digital Solutions </h2>

        <p>To test my digital solutions I could recreate this project from scratch with new content. I could start by creating a flowchart in draw.io to help properly organise how my digital project was going to be created, and then use this to help plan each stage of my project in Trello. The first stage would be content writing, the second stage would be creating the HTML code, and the final stage would be the CSS styling. I would use my Trello board to stay on track, completing my project stage by stage to be more efficient and productive. After the content was written, I would then create separate HTML folders for different sections of my website and work on one section at a time in a methodical approach. When each section was completed, I would use one main CSS file to style my website. Throughout testing my digital solutions, I would utilise the Github version control feature, adding commit messages to organise the changes that I had made.</p>
        <p>Another way to test my digital solutions would be user testing. This would allow others to test my digital project to help analyse more efficient solutions for productivity. User testing is an important element of any digital project and feedback can be invaluable. I would ensure that I had enough users testing my project so that I had enough data to compile a thorough analysis.</p>
