  <h2>1.5 - Describe How You Would Go About Selecting and Using IT Systems and Software</h2> 
  
<p>In order to select which IT systems and software that I would use to create my digital project, I would first outline the objective of the product and detail what I was trying to achieve. From there I would analyse the best IT systems and software that I would use to achieve my objective. </p>

<p>When it comes to IT systems, I would use a laptop for convenience so that I could work from anywhere. An internet connection would be a necessity, and I would also have a mobile phone on hand in case I needed to seek support. Using a laptop to plan my project would also save time compared to traditional manual methods, and produce more accurate and effective results.</p>

<p>I would then evaluate the software tools that would be required to complete my digital project. Next I would search for applicable software tools, remove any non-viable options and then start testing each tool to ensure that it met my needs and were all fully integratable. Once I have all of the software tools that I require, I would ensure that I had the relevant software licenses so that I could proceed with my digital project. <a href="references.html" target="_blank">[18]</a>
