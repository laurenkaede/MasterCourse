  <h2>1.6 - Describe and Provide Analysis on How Your Chosen Technologies Have Helped You Achieve Your Outcomes</h2> 
  <p>Trello has helped me with the planning process of my digital project. When planning my website, I created three lists which would help me to manage the tasks that I’d need to complete. I called the lists ‘to do’, ‘pending’ and ‘done’. I then broke down each task on Trello into their own separate cards and placed them all in the ‘to do’ list. Each task was given a due date to help me to stay on track, and then assigned a colour-coded personalised label to keep my lists organised. As I started each task I moved the corresponding card to the ‘pending’ list. Once the task was completed, I moved the card to the ‘done’ list and where relevant added my content written work to the comments section.</p>

  <p>Trello has been a fundamental tool in the creation of my digital project, and has successfully allowed me to remain on track, and stay within the assigned time line for each task.</p>

  <p>Github is a website that enables the user to host their code and digital projects. It allows teams to work on the same project from different computers and locations. This technology has been a useful tool by providing version control. This is where the user can upload their digital projects, along with ongoing multiple amendments which Github will automatically identify and change appropriately so that the most current version is always available. Each time an upload is made, Github prompts the user to add a commit message so that anyone viewing the project can see which changes can be made.</p>
