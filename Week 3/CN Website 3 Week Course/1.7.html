    <h2>1.7 - Describe Legal Guidelines and Constraints that Impact Digital Projects </h2>

      <p>The General Data Protection Regulation, also known as <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en" target="_blank">GDPR</a>, are the legal guidelines created and designed to protect the rights and privacy of individuals and their personal data. Personal data is classified as any data which can be used to identify an individual, and there are two types of personal data covering different types of information - personal data, and sensitive personal data. These guidelines are legal requirements to all businesses and public sector organisations operating in countries who are part of the European Union, and failure to comply can lead to heavy fines.</p>

      <p>There are two major roles when it comes to the management and processing of data. They are called ‘Data Controllers’ and ‘Data Processors’, and they can either be entities or a person. Data Controllers are those who manage personal data and decide its purpose and how it will be used, whilst a Data Processor will process data on behalf of the Data Controller and this involves collecting, storing, recording and adapting personal data. For example, a web developer creating a website digital project can be either or both.</p>

      <p>GDPR affects both the planning of a digital project, and the development of a digital project. </p>

      <h4>GDPR Constraints Affecting the Planning of Digital Projects</h4>

      <p>The ‘Privacy by Design’ framework is a requirement of GDPR that has a 7 step method to achieve optimal data protection. It is required to be offered as standard procedure, by default and must also be in place across every use of a digital product. A ‘Privacy Impact Statement’, or PIA, is another legal requirement of GDPR. It is a document which must be available to any person working on a digital project, and details the processes by which personal data is discussed, audited and stored. It is also required to detail any identified privacy risks and data breaches, and they are to be avoided and mitigated.It is important that any person working on a digital project has had training on GDPR, and is competent in following the legal guidelines as any data breaches can be subject to an investigation into what training staff have had in regards to GDPR.</p>

      <p>To help prevent data breaches, security and technical measures will need to be in place. These can include secure connections, protected servers, secure staff log-in’s, appropriate access to data and system monitoring.It is also important for digital projects to have legal and updated software licenses, follow branding guidelines, and ensure that they aren’t breaching any copyright laws.</p>

      <h4>GDPR Constraints Affecting the Development of Digital Projects</h4>

      <p>One of the ways to help protect data, is to ensure that everyone working on the digital project follows the same set of approved and defined tools, frameworks and coding libraries. Any unnecessary or unsafe modules should be disabled, and any code reviews should detail how data is being stored and protected.</p>

      <p>Data should be encrypted and anonymised where possible, deleted where no longer required, and only collected if needed. On the front end, developers need to ensure that users have the control mechanisms needed to control all aspects of their data - including account settings and privacy centres. Users should have access to features that will allow them to download their data, edit their data and delete their data. On the back end, developers need to ensure that users can give consent when it comes to collecting their data, and then that consent should then be fully documented. <a href="references.html" target="_blank">[21]</a> <a href="references.html" target="_blank">[22]</a> <a href="references.html" target="_blank">[23]</a>
