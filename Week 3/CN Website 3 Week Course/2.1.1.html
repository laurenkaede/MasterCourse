        <h4>Home Page </h4>

        <p>The home page details the outcomes of this digital project and tells you who it belongs to.

The text is written in white colour and I’ve added a shadow to the text to improve readability. I’ve changed the colour of the text on some headings to help distinguish different sections. There is a navigation bar at the top of the webpage with drop-down menus that enables the user to access any part of my website.</p>
