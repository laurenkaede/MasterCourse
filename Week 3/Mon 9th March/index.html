    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <div class="txtindent">
        <p contenteditable="true" spellchecker="true">Hello, my name’s Lauren and I’m a tech enthusiast from Manchester.
            Everything changed when I became really interested in online business, and how technology impacts the lives
            of others. Technological innovation is something I’m really passionate about, and in today’s digital world a
            lot of businesses are finding success online. This of course creates a lot of opportunities, and I’ve spent
            hours researching how to start my own online business, particularly in e-commerce and digital products.</p>

        <p contenteditable="true" spellchecker="true">During this process, I watched a lot of tutorials, read lots of
            books, and took a few online courses in subjects including digital marketing and JavaScript. This led me to
            build my own Shopify store and my own website in WordPress. But ultimately I realised that I didn’t want to
            be using someone else's software to create something that everyone else was creating… I wanted to create
            something that was my own work, that I could build from scratch.</p>

        <p contenteditable="true" spellchecker="true">And that’s what led me to take a coding course here at Code
            Nation. On day 3 of the course, we were set a challenge to build an ATM using Python. And after completing
            the challenge and making my tweaks, I sat back and ran the code. And that moment when you see that it works
            is just an incredible feeling. A huge smile broke out on my face and I was so excited. It was at that moment
            that it all just clicked for me and I realised that I’d finally found what I was supposed to be doing.</p>

        <p contenteditable="true" spellchecker="true">Software development allows me to be creative and to use my brain
            to solve problems. But most importantly I will get to help people which is so rewarding and something I’m
            really passionate about. My goal is to build an exciting and rewarding career as a software developer, and I
            look forward to the challenges and growth of the future.</p>

    <h2>Why I Wanted to Join Code Nation</h2>

    <div class="txtindent">

        <p contenteditable="true" spellchecker="true">I was interested in joining Code Nation to learn how to code and
            to
            enter into the Software Development industry. I wanted a change of career and believed that Code Nation
            would be
            a fundamental part of achieving that. The goal was to gain an apprenticeship through Code Nation as an
            Apprentice Junior Software Developer.</p>

        <h2>Week 1 Targets and Progress Made in Achieving Goals</h2>

        <h3>Targets</h3>

        <p contenteditable="true" spellchecker="true">My goals in the first week were to learn the fundamentals of
            JavaScript and become comfortable with JS as a programming language. The first week I focused on learning
            the
            basics.</p>

        <h3>Progress</h3>

        <p contenteditable="true" spellchecker="true">So far I have learnt a lot about the basics of using JavaScript. I
            have focused on learning about 'objects,' 'loops' and 'classes,' for example. To aid in my learning, I have
            used
            PowerPoint presentations, textbooks, online tutorials and various websites to help me achieve my goals and
            complete challenges.</p>
